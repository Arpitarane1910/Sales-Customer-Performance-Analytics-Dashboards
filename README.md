# Sales & Customer Performance Analytics Dashboards

## Project Overview

This project involves the development of two interactive Tableau dashboards to analyze sales performance and customer behavior for stakeholders, including sales managers, executives, and marketing teams. The dashboards provide actionable insights into key performance indicators (KPIs), trends, and customer segments, enabling data-driven decision-making.

- **Sales Dashboard**: Tracks total sales, profits, and quantity with year-over-year comparisons, monthly/weekly trends, and product subcategory performance.
- **Customer Dashboard**: Analyzes customer KPIs, monthly trends, order distribution, and top profit-generating customers.

## Objectives

- Enable stakeholders to identify sales trends 20% faster through visualized year-over-year data and highlighted performance metrics.
- Improve customer retention strategies by 15% by providing insights into customer behavior and top profit contributors.
- Reduce data query time by 25% with dynamic filters for product and geographic data.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Tableau**: Used for dashboard creation and visualization.
- **Tableau Public**: Hosted the dashboards for public access.
